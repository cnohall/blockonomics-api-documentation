# Limits

You can query max 100 addresses at a time. For higher number you should upgrade your plan and set your <b>API Key</b> in HTTP authorization header. Please limit API calls to 2 requests/min. Higher rates can lead to banning of your IP. Bitcoin blocks only arrive at an average rate of once in 10 minutes. So querying multiple times a second won't return you any new data. For realtime transaction updates on address, use our <b><a href="/payments/payment-notification" target="_blank">websocket API</a></b>.
