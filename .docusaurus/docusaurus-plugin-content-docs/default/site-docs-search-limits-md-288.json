  "description": "You can query max 100 addresses at a time. For higher number you should upgrade your plan and set your API Key in HTTP authorization header. Please limit API calls to 2 requests/min. Higher rates can lead to banning of your IP. Bitcoin blocks only arrive at an average rate of once in 10 minutes. So querying multiple times a second won't return you any new data. For realtime transaction updates on address, use our websocket API.",
